Data Science, Machine Learning & AI 
📌 Objective

This repository documents my journey to becoming a Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer, showcasing my skills in:

Data Analysis & Visualization

Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence

Deep Learning with TensorFlow/Keras

Data Engineering Tools (Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Spark, Kafka)

It serves as a portfolio for potential employers and collaborators to explore my projects, coding style, and problem-solving ability.
